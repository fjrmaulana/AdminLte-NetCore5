# ASPNET CORE 5 AdminLTE 
This project uses Asp.net Core 5, I made it as minimal as possible to learn for beginners, especially those who use the .NET programming language with familiarity.
there are some things that need to be considered when the developer has a problem and finally the developer knows what he means in the AdminLTE html class attribute

<b>body class='hold-transition sidebar-mini'</b>
This functions so that when the nav (side panel menu) is collapsed, the icon image will appear and only the icon will appear next to it
<br>
<b>div class='wrapper'</b>
This function is to collapse the nav when the mouse is clicked, if it is responsive into Mobile form
